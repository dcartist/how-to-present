# Presentation tips

There are different avenues when it comes to making presentations. You can use items like PowerPoint, Google Slides, reveal.js (https://revealjs.com/installation/), but one of the best ways is using your project's README.

## Presentation tips



Write a good README. When you write a detailed Readme helps when making a presentation. You will not have to remember as much because it is already written in your README. Your README is your guide to your presentation.



Outline what you want to talk about in your presentation. Things to keep in mind when writing a readme

- What is your project
- How does it work?
- What is something unique about it?
- What were your challenges?
- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?



### When it comes to presentation, here are some tips:

- Practice your presentation with other people and get their feedback
- Record yourself doing your presentation to get an understanding of how others will see you
- Take pauses, and don't rush through everything.
- Make sure to drink water before a presentation. Hydration is key! 
- Be clear and concise. 
- Listen to music beforehand that makes you feel happy and want to sing; people can feel that happiness.
- It's okay to be nervous, and sometimes saying, "Give me a moment I am a bit nervous," helps get over the initial fear.
- Clean your Desktop and turn off your notifications when screen sharing; also, go for "non-offensive" backgrounds. The fewer distractions, the better.
- Leave some time for questions and be ready to talk about your project in detail.

### Handling bugs

If your project has bugs, there are different ways to handle them.

- - Bug vs. Feature - Somethings that you would think of as a bug could be considered a feature. (https://levelup.gitconnected.com/7-bugs-that-turned-into-useful-features-later-d7bbb8351f3c)
  - If it crashes out complete, then don't trigger it. Emphasize things/sections of code that do work. For the areas that don't work, talk about upcoming features you are working on.

â€‹	For the epic, everything is a dumpster fire; nothing works; make sure to breathe. We all had epic moments; even Steve Jobs had a few of those. You are human! You can focus more on showing your idea/concepts and planning.
